# Object Relational Mapping in Javascript: Comparing Sequelize and Prisma

An ORM is a programming technique used to interact with databases using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It provides a high level abstraction to interact with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) by representing tables as objects in your code

ORMs allow developers to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database by use of objects, instead of writing raw SQL queries. This makes the development process smoother and less error prone

## Benefits of using an ORM

### Simplicity and Developer Experience
- ORMs take away the complexities of SQL queries and allows developers to interact with databses using familiar programming paradigms. This leads to a faster development process and reduced learning curves and especially benefits developers who arent SQL experts



### Portability and SQL Dialect Handling
  - ORMs typically support multiple database systems. This means you can switch from SQLite during development to PostgreSQL in production with minimal code changes. Your application becomes database-agnostic, as the ORM handles the translation of your code to the appropriate SQL dialect.
