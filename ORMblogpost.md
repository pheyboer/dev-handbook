Object Relational Mapping in Javascript

An ORM is a programming technique used to interact with databases using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. It provides a high level abstraction to interact with relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite) by representing tables as objects in your code

ORMs allow developers to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database by use of objects, instead of writing raw SQL queries. This makes the development process smoother and less error prone

Benefits of using an ORM
